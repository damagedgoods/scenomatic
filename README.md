# Scenomatic

## What's this?

Just an experiment I did for a drawing session. The exercise consisted of generating random scenes with the tool and then everybody in the room had to draw them. It's funny.

Of course, you can use it as you want: to generate random names & surnames for your future baby, risky cooking recipes, as an stimuli for workshops or ideation sessions, etc.

## How to use Scenomatic with your own data

1. At https://github.com/damagedgoods/scenomatic, click "Clone or download" and then "Download ZIP".
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Edit the file js/data.js. Change "sujetos", "verbos" and "modos" arrays to add or edit values. Just make sure you respect the syntax. Save the changes.
4. Open index.html in your browser.
5. Click "Otro!" to generate a new scene.
6. If you press B the "Bonus" mode is activated for the next scene, including additional challenges.

## Caveats

Code is horrible. Only tested in Chrome, it's not responsive. :-(

I still don't know if I will be fixing or editing this. Just let me know if you need anything.
